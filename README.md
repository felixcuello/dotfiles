# profile

This is my personal profile and the things I usually use. To configure this profile, just clone it and run `make` to get help on how to install the profile on your system

```
$ make
Felix Profile Installer

make macos_install     # for MacOS Systems
make ubuntu_install    # for Ubuntu Systems [incomplete]
```

For now only `neovim` configuration is there, but I will eventually add more things that I like to use for other software.
